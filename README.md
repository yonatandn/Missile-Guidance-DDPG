## DRL Guided Missile

Our project focuses on the challenging task of guiding a 2-dimensional free-falling missile to hit a target using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The objective involves real-time decision-making to apply horizontal forces along the missile's trajectory to achieve precise targeting. Throughout this project, we leverage deep neural networks and the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) agent to tackle this problem, demonstrating the potential of DRL in solving complex real-time control tasks. The following overview provides insights into our approach and results in this intriguing endeavor.
